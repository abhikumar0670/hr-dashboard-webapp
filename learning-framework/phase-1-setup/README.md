# Phase 1: Setup

This phase contains the minimal setup for the HR Performance Dashboard project.

## What is included?
- Next.js project structure
- Tailwind CSS configuration
- Zustand installed and a basic store

## How to use
- Copy the minimal code from the main project (just enough to run the app and see a basic page).
- Do **not** include advanced features, UI components, or employee management yet.

See `EXPLANATION.md` for a step-by-step guide.
