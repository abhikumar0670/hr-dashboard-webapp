# Phase 4: Advanced Features

## Goal
Implement advanced features such as filters, bulk actions, modals, and enhanced employee management.

## What You'll Learn
- How to build advanced UI features (filters, bulk actions)
- How to use modals for user interactions
- How to manage complex employee data (skills, performance, leave, etc.)

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Advanced Filters
- Allow users to filter employees by multiple criteria (department, status, etc.).
- Use controlled components and state to manage filter values.

### 2. Bulk Actions
- Enable actions on multiple employees at once (e.g., delete, update status).
- Use checkboxes and a bulk action bar.

### 3. Modals
- Use React portals or libraries to show modals for creating/editing employees, reviews, leave requests, etc.

### 4. Enhanced Employee Management
- Track additional fields: salary, hire date, manager, skills, performance history, leave, projects, goals, etc.
